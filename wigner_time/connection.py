"""
The choice made here is to model our ADwin connections as little more than dictionaries of information. This allows for the least amount of coupling with other implementations. Rather than plain dictionaries, we use the 'munch' library for the nice attribute features e.g. 'd.module = 1'.

The reason for not simply using a dictionary (rather than an object) is to allow for the insertion of default values and easy instantiation of multiple objects of the same type.
TODO: I'm not sure about this anymore - consider it subject to review! Maybe we should avoid dictionaries entirely and just use DataFrame objects? This might be expensive memory-wise?

Once the connections have associated functions, then consider putting them within their own namespaces. Functions that manipulate the values should be as independent as possible however.

TODO:
reset the default values
