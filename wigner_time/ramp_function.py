    origin/terminus are time-value pairs
    `sharpness` is a measure of how linear the 'slope' of the function is around the halfway point and in practice is used for easing transitions between the end-points. For example, sharpness ~0 (!=0) gives a linear ramp between `origin` and `terminus`, whereas large values approximate a step-function at the half-way point. In-between these values, the ramps returned will start and end gradually, with a linear movement in the middle.
